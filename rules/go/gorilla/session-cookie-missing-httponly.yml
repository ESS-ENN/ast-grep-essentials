message: >-
  A session cookie was detected without setting the 'HttpOnly' flag.
  The 'HttpOnly' flag for cookies instructs the browser to forbid
  client-side scripts from reading the cookie which mitigates XSS
  attacks. Set the 'HttpOnly' flag by setting 'HttpOnly' to 'true'
  in the Options struct.
